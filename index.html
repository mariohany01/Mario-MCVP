							<p id="paragraph1" data-image="image1.png">Hey! It's Mario Hany, but call me Super Mario! I'm 23. Lived in Maadi, Egypt for like 6 years, then bounced to October. Started school at Cairo Language School, first couple grades, then moved again to October Gardens, Orascom Deutsch School! Did the whole Goethe thing, A1, A2, B1, yeah, trying to get those levels up, gotta travel, you know? Thanaweya amma scared the crap out of me. Switched to an American school. SAT 1 1400/1600! Nailed it for American schools.</p>
							<p id="paragraph2" data-image="image2.jpg">Always wanted to be an architect, like, since forever. But when I hit MUST in 2019, went into engineering, mechatronics, and that was the best choice ever. First couple years? Brutal! American school to Egyptian engineering, HUGE jump. Got used to it though. Third year, started the Formula Student team, FSAE, building an F1 car, right? Meetings, work, 5 months, software, testing... then, no funding. Club deleted. Sad times. Piano? Started at 6, Dr. Maher, amazing teacher, orchestra leader from Netherlands. Taught me the basics, then he passed away. Miss that dude. Kept learning on my own, YouTube, self-taught, still at it. Got my own band, "صدفه) "Sodfa), five of us, piano, guitar, drums, bass, vocals. Parties in cafes, universities, you name it. First big one? NUSU opening. Then AUC Got Talent, finals, didn't win, oh well.</p>
							<p id="paragraph3" data-image="image3.jpg">2019, first love. Thought, I'm gonna study, work, marry her at 25-26.' but broke up in 2022. Heartbroken, didn't know what to do. Hisham Saqr told me about AIESEC. Didn't get it, but joined to, like, forget stuff, kill time. Wasn't even sure about AIESEC, did a one-day registration, was like, 'What am I doing?' Roll call? What's that? Then, I loved it! The more I gave, the more I got. Top performer at AIESEC in MUST -Holmies-, broke the record! then applied as Team leader in OGV -SuperMarios-, not the best peak still learning about aiesec and leadership. Then Fusion'23, VP Finance - OC سرينه Vol.1 -, LOVED the conferences. After that, OCP role, Ignite'24-OC Bermuda-, MUST, best experience ever! Learned so much, tried new strategies, and fixed my team leader mistakes. Applied for VP Finance, Momentum 24 -OC سرينه Vol.2 -, national experience, hard work, learned about finance, submissions, everything. Adham Ashraf and Ziad Maher were awesome coaches. Finished Momentum, AIESEC Egypt released OCP for Fusion'24 -OC شفره-, jumped on it! National level, tougher, but best AIESEC experience so far. Then RPM - OC حورس -, second international conference, IM role, learned so much about Google Sheets, AppScript, took Udemy courses, even made a mobile app for inventory, App Sheets, user experience, boom! Joined Mondy's market expansion team, opened New Capital, new AIESEC startup, and released LCP application! Now? Looking for the next AIESEC adventure, more experience, connections, Egypt, abroad, bring it on!</p>
